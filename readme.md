## Overview

In this project I analysed one of the datasets on [Kaggle Diabetes Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets) centered on Diabetes. My aim was to build a classification model to see if it could predict cases of previous gestational diabetes based on some features. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marshalpatel3558/diabetes-prediction-dataset) contained 10,000 rows and  21 columns of data. I also used an automated EDA process with the ydataprofiling library which was quite exciting and the result is in the index.html file. Feel free to check out the [YData Profiling EDA report](https://sotun-1010.github.io/diabetes_eda/). Find the link to the [diabetes classifcation model](https://github.com/Sotun-1010/gestational_diabetes_classification) here too.
